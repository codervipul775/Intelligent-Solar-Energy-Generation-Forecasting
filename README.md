# Intelligent Solar Energy Generation Forecasting and Agentic Grid Optimization System

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement an **AI-driven solar energy forecasting and grid optimization system**. The system predicts solar power generation using historical and weather-related data and extends this capability into an **agentic AI assistant** that generates structured, explainable recommendations for grid optimization and energy utilization.

The project is developed in **two milestones**:

- **Milestone 1:** Machine Learning–based Solar Energy Forecasting
- **Milestone 2:** Agentic AI Grid Optimization Assistant

The final application is **publicly hosted**, uses **only free-tier/open-source tools**, and provides a **user-friendly web interface**.

## Problem Statement & Use Case

Solar energy generation is highly variable due to weather conditions and seasonal patterns. Grid operators require accurate forecasts and intelligent decision support to:

- Balance supply and demand
- Reduce energy wastage
- Improve renewable energy integration
- Plan storage and load shifting strategies

This project provides:

- Accurate short-term/long-term solar generation forecasts
- Automated analysis of variability and risk
- AI-generated, structured grid optimization recommendations
